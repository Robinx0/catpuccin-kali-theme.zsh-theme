# catpuccin-kali-theme.zsh-theme
This is a theme inspired from oh-my-posh catpuccin-"flavor" theme for oh-my-zsh. 

This is how it looked on the oh-my-posh theme list :

This is my approach to recreate it for zsh :

I used my own dark mode color theme, you may change them how you want, instructions are commented in the code also.
